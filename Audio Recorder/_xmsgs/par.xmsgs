<msg type="warning" file="Timing" num="3402" delta="old" >The Clock Modifying COMP, <arg fmt="%s" index="1">clock_gen/dcm_sp_inst</arg>, has the attribute CLK_FEEDBACK set to NONE.  No phase relationship exists between the input and output clocks of this Clock Modifying COMP. Data paths between these clock domains must be constrained using FROM/TO constraints.

<msg type="warning" file="Par" num="468" delta="old" >Your design did not meet timing.  The following are some suggestions to assist you to meet timing in your design.

Review the timing report using Timing Analyzer (In ISE select &quot;Post-Place &amp;
Route Static Timing Report&quot;). Go to the failing constraint(s) and evaluate the failing paths for each constraint.

Try the Design Goal and Strategies for Timing Performance(In ISE select Project -&gt; Design Goals &amp; Strategies) to ensure the best options are set in the tools for timing closure.
